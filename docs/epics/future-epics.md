# Future Epics

Based on PRD Section 2 (Future Enhancements):

- **Epic 7:** Advanced Editing & Customization (script editing in UI, voiceover regeneration per scene, voice switching)
- **Epic 8:** Enhanced Visual Control (manual search within UI, text overlays)
- **Epic 9:** Stock Footage API Integration (Pexels, Pixabay as alternative/supplementary sources to YouTube)
- **Epic 10:** Custom Persona Creation (user-defined personas, persona import/export, advanced LLM settings)

**Notes:**
- Voice selection moved from Epic 6 to Core Epic 2
- Preset persona system moved from Epic 9 to Core Epic 1 (Story 1.8)
- Channel Intelligence (RAG) moved from Future Epic 6 to Enhancement Epic 6 (2025-11-29)

### Epic 9 Details (Future)

**Goal:** Add professional stock footage sources as alternatives or supplements to YouTube content.

**Technical Approach:**
- Integrate Pexels API for high-quality stock video clips
- Integrate Pixabay API for additional royalty-free content
- Implement source selection/priority system (YouTube vs stock footage)
- Allow mixed sourcing (some scenes from YouTube, others from stock)

**User Value:** Access to professional, commercial-grade stock footage for creators who need more polished visuals or want to avoid YouTube-specific licensing concerns.

**Story Estimate:** 3-4 stories per API integration
