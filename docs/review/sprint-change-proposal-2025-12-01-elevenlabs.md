# Sprint Change Proposal: ElevenLabs TTS Integration

**Date:** 2025-12-01
**Requested By:** User (master)
**Change Type:** New Feature Addition
**Scope:** Minor (PRD update only)

---

## Section 1: Issue Summary

**Problem Statement:**
The current TTS system only supports Kokoro (local, FOSS) for voiceover generation. Users who want premium, cloud-based voice quality have no alternative option within the application.

**Discovery Context:**
User request to add ElevenLabs API as an alternative TTS provider alongside Kokoro, with separate voice catalogs and usage tracking.

**Evidence:**
- Current system locked to single TTS provider (Kokoro)
- ElevenLabs offers premium voice quality via API
- Aligns with "FOSS-first, cloud-enhanced" philosophy (Kokoro = FOSS, ElevenLabs = cloud option)
- Follows existing provider pattern (Ollama/Gemini for LLM)

---

## Section 2: Impact Analysis

### Epic Impact
- **Epic 2 (Script & Voiceover):** Requires new story for ElevenLabs integration
- **Other Epics:** No impact

### Artifact Impact
| Artifact | Impact | Action Required |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| PRD | Addition | Add Feature 1.13 (DONE) |
| Epics | Addition | Add Story for ElevenLabs (Architect) |
| Architecture | Minor | Add TTS provider abstraction, API client (Architect) |
| UX Design | Minor | Provider toggle in Voice Selection, usage dashboard (Architect) |

### Technical Impact
- New TTS provider abstraction interface
- ElevenLabs API client implementation
- Database columns for usage tracking
- UI components for provider selection and quota display

---

## Section 3: Recommended Approach

**Selected Path:** Direct Adjustment (Option 1)

**Rationale:**
1. Clean additive feature extending existing Voice Selection
2. Follows established provider pattern (like LLM providers)
3. Low effort (~2-3 days implementation)
4. Low risk (isolated to voiceover generation)
5. High user value (premium voice quality option)

**Effort Estimate:** Low-Medium
**Risk Level:** Low
