# Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for the AI Video Generator MVP with clear paths for future enhancement. All decisions prioritize FOSS compliance, local-first privacy, and developer experience while maintaining the flexibility to scale to cloud multi-tenant deployment when needed.

The modular design with abstraction layers (LLM provider, state management, API boundaries) ensures that AI agents implementing individual epics will write consistent, compatible code.

**Next Steps:**
1. Execute project initialization commands
2. Implement Epic 1 (Conversational Agent) first
3. Iterate through epics 2-5 sequentially
4. Run validation workflow before Phase 4 implementation
