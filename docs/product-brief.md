Product Brief: AI Video Generator (Draft)
1. Problem Statement Creating  informative videos is a complex and time-consuming process that requires research, scriptwriting, voiceover recording, and video editing. This product aims to automate this entire workflow, allowing a user to generate a complete video from a single conversational prompt.

2. Target Audience The primary user is you—a creator who wants to move quickly from an idea to a finished video, prioritizing speed and efficiency.

3. Success Metrics The product will be successful if it enables you to:

Save Time: Drastically reduce video production time from hours to minutes.
Increase Output: Significantly increase the volume of content you can produce.
Improve Consistency: Maintain a steady stream of content without burnout.
4. Core Features (MVP)

Conversational AI Agent
Automated Script Generation
Automated Voiceover
AI-Powered Visual Sourcing
Visual Curation UI
Automated Video Assembly
Automated Thumbnail Generation
5. High-Level User Journey

Initiation & Brainstorming: The user starts a natural language conversation with the AI agent to brainstorm and refine a video idea.
Command: The user gives a simple command within the chat to "make a video" on the chosen topic.
Curation: The user is presented with a simple UI where they review the AI-generated script and select the best B-roll clip for each scene from a list of AI-curated suggestions.
Completion: After making their selections, the user triggers the final render and receives a complete, ready-to-share video file and a generated thumbnail.
6. Out of Scope (MVP)

Background Music: No automated or user-selected background music will be included in the initial release.
